Semantic-UI

Who
	Jack Lukic
What
	Front end framework for design
	similar to bootstrap
When
	2013
Why
	Easier to write
	individual componenets
	Components that are not available in other frameworks
		ratings
		dimmer
		UI-View
			Comments
			Feeds
			Items
			List
		
	Componenets that are avaliable in other frameworks
		grids
		forms
		modals

Pros
	set of individual components
		can be used without needing the entire framework
		
	For developer
		real-time debug output
		
	Mix and match with other frameworks
		only pull in buttons or grids
	
	tag agnostic - use any html tags with UI elements.
	
	Looks pretty
	
	Has tests
		
Cons
	Still being worked on
	Prerelease - v0.17.0
	Not every component is there currently

Compare to Bootstrap
	Very similar to bootstrap
	has most of the same components
		buttons
		forms
		checkboxes
		
	human friendly class names
	

other stuff
	Semantics - study of meaning with focus on words/phrases/signs
	using natural langauge to convey meaning.
		more about describing what's happening
	linguisticly semantic
		class names reads like english
	Got traction before it was ready for prime time.
	
	Browser Support
		Last 2 Versions FF, Chrome, IE (aka 10+)
		Safari 6
		Firefox 12
		IE 9+ (Browser prefix only)
		Android 3
		Blackberry 10
	
	Things planned for 1.0
